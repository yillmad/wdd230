                <p>
                    Apple's website effectively uses visual hierarchy to guide users' attention. The prominent placement 
                    of product images and headlines creates a clear focal point. Important elements such as new product 
                    releases and featured content are larger and bolder, while secondary information like links to support 
                    and services are smaller. This prioritization helps users quickly identify what's most important and 
                    navigate the site efficiently.

                <p>
                    Google's homepage is a prime example of clean design and effective use of white space. The majority 
                    of the page is empty except for the Google logo, search bar, and a few buttons. This simplicity not 
                    only makes the page aesthetically pleasing but also keeps the focus on the primary action â€“ searching. 
                    The generous white space ensures that users aren't overwhelmed with unnecessary information.

                     alt="example of repetition from the Amazon's website">
                <p>
                    Amazon employs the principle of repetition consistently throughout its website. Product listings have 
                    a uniform layout with repetition in terms of the placement of product images, titles, prices, and 
                    "Add to Cart" buttons. This repetition creates a sense of consistency and familiarity, making it easier 
                    for users to understand and navigate the site. Additionally, Amazon uses consistent navigation menus 
                    and headers across its various pages, further reinforcing the principle of repetition for a seamless 
                    user experience.
